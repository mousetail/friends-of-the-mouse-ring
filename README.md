# Friends of The Mouse Ring

A webring for sites made by people I have tangentally interacted with. No particular theme. Even just sharing
the same discord server or chat room would count.

## What is a Web Ring

In it's simplest form, it's a loop of sites that all link to the "next" site in the ring. It creates
a conveninet way to browse sites about a similar topic without use of a search engine.

## How does it work?

Currently, I use onionring: [https://garlic.garden/onionring/](https://garlic.garden/onionring/).
That means I'm bound to the "Cooperative Non-Violent Licence" with is a bit unfortunate since
such licences create a lot of legal ambiguity but since this is a joke project should not be likely to
cause issues.
